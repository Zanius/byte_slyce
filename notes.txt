To run the app:

1. Clone the git repo
2. cd into the cloned directory
3. run `docker-compose up`
4. navigate to `localhost:8080`

This command will start two containers, a phoenix server and a postgres database.

This will run phoenix in the test environment and run several ExUnit tests and Wallaby tests running
on headless chrome.
