Requirements: 
Docker, Docker Compose

Tested with :
- docker 20.10.2
- docker-compose 1.25.0

To run the app:

1. Clone the git repo
2. cd into the cloned directory
3. run: docker-compose up
4. navigate to: localhost:8080

This command will start two containers, a phoenix server and a postgres database.

To run the test suite:

1. cd into the directory
2. run: docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint="/app/entrypoint.test.sh" phoenix

This will run phoenix in the test environment and starts several ExUnit and Wallaby tests running
on headless chrome. The --rm command will ensure the container is destroyed when the test suite is finished.

Disclaimer:
My current day-to-day stack is ruby on rails, but I recently started picking up elixir for side projects
